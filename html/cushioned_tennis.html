                            One of the primary reasons we love this shoe is its exceptional performance packaged in a lightweight design. While durability might be a concern due to Nike’s focus on minimizing weight, we’re more than happy to make that trade-off.

                            Additionally, the shoe includes a cozy bootie on the inside that secures your foot in place, while the outer layer incorporates New Balance's Kinetic Stitch technology for enhanced stability.

                            In the midsole, you'll find FlyteFoam, a lightweight EVA foam that enhances mobility, along with Gel technology at both the front and back of the shoe for excellent shock absorption. Additionally, the shoe incorporates a Trustic System that helps prevent twisting and maintains balance.
