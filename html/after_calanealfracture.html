                <h4>5 Best Shoe After Calcaneal Fracture Reviewed & Rated 2024</h4>

                <p>Before we dive deeper into the discussion, let's first explain what a calcaneal fracture is. A calcaneal fracture refers to a break in the calcaneus, which is the heel bone. This large bone forms the foundation of the rear part of the foot and is connected to both the talus and the cuboid bone.

                    <br><br>

                    The talus is responsible for forming the lower ankle joint, while the cuboid connects the ankle to the foot. The calcaneus itself consists of spongy bone tissue that is encased in a hard outer shell, providing both strength and flexibility.
