                <h4>Top 10 Best Shoes for Bone Spurs 2024</h4>

                <p>A bone spur is an extra growth of bone that typically develops where two or more bones meet. During the body’s repair process, projections can form, leading to the development of bone spurs, which feel like hard lumps beneath the surface. Several risk factors contribute to this condition, including osteoarthritis, age, wearing tight shoes, physical activity, and flat feet. <br><br> A heel spur is specifically associated with the abnormal growth of the heel bone, which is the main bone in the foot responsible for absorbing shock and pressure. When calcium deposits form, they can cause connective tissue to pull away from the heel, resulting in a bony protrusion, or heel spur. This condition can lead to significant pain in the rear foot, especially during standing or walking. Additionally, bone spurs on the top of the foot may develop due to osteoarthritis, with other contributing factors being foot injuries, obesity, and wearing tight shoes.
