                <h4>Top 5 Best Shoes After Triple Arthrodesis 2024</h4>

                <p>Arthrodesis is the medical term for fusion, a procedure in which bones are joined together by removing the cartilage on the joint surface, resulting in the formation of a bone bridge at the joint. In simpler terms, it is the fusion of a joint between two or more bones, rendering the joint immobile.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    Triple arthrodesis refers specifically to the fusion of the hindfoot, used to address various deformities and foot problems. After undergoing the triple arthrodesis procedure, the bones are locked in place and become immobile, allowing the joints to function smoothly without causing pain.
