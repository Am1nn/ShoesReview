                            The upper portion of these boots is crafted from high-quality, ruddy reddish-brown leather, featuring triple stitching for added durability. The thick rubber sole provides ample traction, ensuring a strong grip on various surfaces. Designed as lace-up boots, they come with long-lasting steel eyelets and a removable polyurethane footbed for comfort and support. The Irish Setter work boots require minimal break-in time, making them convenient right out of the box.
                            <br><br>
                            These boots offer immediate comfort upon first wear, as the high-quality leather softens after just a day of use. The EVA midsole, equipped with a removable cushion, ensures enduring comfort, while the padded collar and tongue provide additional cushioning around the ankle to prevent rubbing.

                            <br><br>
                            These boots meet safety standards, specifically Electrical Hazard ASTM F2892-11, making them safe to wear in environments where electric shock is a risk. However, unlike traditional steel-toe work boots, they are not designed to withstand compression. Additionally, these boots are heat-resistant, capable of withstanding temperatures up to 475°F.

                            The upper portion of these boots is crafted from high-quality brown leather, ensuring durability and style. The outer sole is made of robust rubber, providing a strong grip on various surfaces. Additionally, the midsole features EVA foam, which enhances comfort during wear. The boots are constructed with triple stitching for added durability, and they include an aluminum toe that is lightweight while still offering effective protection. These Irish Setter work boots require only a short break-in period before they feel comfortable.

                            <br><br>
                            When you take them out of the box, these boots are surprisingly comfortable right from the start. After wearing them for just one day, the leather becomes noticeably softer and more pliable. The EVA padded insole is removable, allowing for customized comfort, and the collar and tongue are also cushioned, providing support around the ankle while preventing rubbing and irritation.
                            <br><br>
                            While these boots meet the ASTM F2892-11 electrical hazard safety standards, they are not designed to withstand heavy compression like traditional steel-toe boots. They do offer heat resistance, withstanding temperatures up to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. However, it's important to note that these boots are not waterproof, so applying a water-resistant treatment before wearing them in wet conditions is recommended.
