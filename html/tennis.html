                            The shoes come in vibrant colors, aligning with the latest fashion trends, making them a stylish choice on and off the court. Weighing just 13 ounces, they are lightweight and suitable even for beginners starting out in the sport.

Additionally, when wet, these shoes take a longer time to dry, which could be inconvenient during extended play in damp conditions. Despite these minor flaws, they remain a great choice for performance and style.

                            It comes with an Ortholite insole that provides superior cushioning under the foot and arch, making it ideal even for those with wider feet. The shoe’s low-to-the-ground design enhances comfort and protection, allowing for better stability during play.

                            A TPU cage wraps around the foot, offering additional stability and support. However, one downside is that this well-cushioned tennis shoe lacks sufficient traction. Additionally, it may cause some rubbing around the ankles, potentially leading to minor discomfort or irritation during play.

                            Despite these minor issues, the shoe excels in providing cushioning and support, making it a solid choice for players prioritizing comfort.

                            It features gender-specific Gel cushioning in both the forefoot and rearfoot, designed to absorb shock and reduce the impact of forceful landings. The midsole is made from SOLYTE, which is lighter than both EVA and SpEVA materials, yet still provides excellent support.

                            The upper part of the shoe is constructed with FLEXION FIT technology, offering full-foot support for enhanced performance. Additionally, the heel is lined with two layers of memory foam, increasing both stability and grip on the court.

                            <br><br>

                            However, one drawback is the narrow and small toe box, which may cause discomfort for some wearers. Additionally, the shoe lacks sufficient breathability, making it less suitable for extended play sessions in hot conditions. Despite these issues, it remains a durable and supportive option for shorter periods of play.

                            The shoe features a seamless upper that enhances comfort and fits snugly around the ankle, improving stability during movement on the court.

                            However, this shoe is not built for long-term durability, which may be a major drawback for some.
