                            Runners and walkers dealing with knee pain often recommend shoes from the Asics GEL-Equipped Collection, such as the GEL-Quickwalk, GEL-Foundation Walker 3, and GEL-Nimbus. Originally launched in the 1980s, this collection has since expanded to offer shoes for various sports, including tennis and volleyball, with a focus on providing comfort and support for those with joint pain.

                            Previously known as Orthaheel, Vionics with Orthaheel technology offer a cost-effective alternative to custom orthotics. According to reader Diane Grasely, “If you don’t have prescription orthotics, they’re the best option.” She even mentions being able to comfortably walk her dog while wearing their flip-flops, thanks to the built-in arch support.
                            <br><br>
                            Both Asics and Vionics are popular choices for those in need of supportive footwear, ensuring comfort and stability whether you're walking, running, or simply going about your daily activities.

                            Skechers are highly regarded for their ability to flex and twist, promoting a more natural stride while walking. This flexibility makes them a go-to choice for individuals with knee pain, as the shoes adapt to the foot’s movement, providing comfort and ease of mobility.

                            <br><br>
                            The Skechers GOwalk series, in particular, is a favorite among those dealing with knee issues, including reader Penny Letchford. Known for its lightweight design, this slip-on shoe offers both practicality and support, allowing for easy wear and removal.
                            <br><br>
                            With a spacious forefoot, an odor-resistant liner, and features that prevent slippage, the Skechers GOwalk is a solid option for those seeking relief from knee discomfort while enjoying comfort throughout the day.

                            Puma is not only known for its stylish designs but also for offering lightweight and flexible sneakers and running shoes. A study published in Arthritis Care and Research examined the H-Street model and found that flat, flexible footwear significantly reduces the load on knee joints compared to more rigid, supportive shoes with stiffer soles.

                            <br><br>
                            When wearing flip-flops, flat walking shoes, or walking barefoot, the stress on knee joints was found to be 15 percent lower.

                            Although the H-Street model has been discontinued, the 76 Runner provides a similar experience and is available for both men and women. This makes it a great alternative for those seeking comfortable footwear that supports knee health.
